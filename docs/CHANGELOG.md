### üîß Changed

#### UI/UX Improvements

- **Responsive Design**: All features work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls with smart refresh system
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, animations, and transitions throughout

  - Added 7 advanced feature integrations
  - Enhanced table structure with checkbox column
  - Improved loading states
  - Added external library CDN links

### üêõ Fixed

**CRITICAL Bug - Table colspan mismatch (5 instances)**
- **Issue**: Table had 5 columns originally, but Quick Actions Toolbar added a checkbox column making it 6 columns total. All loading/error/empty states still used `colspan="5"`, breaking the layout.
- **Impact**: Layout visually broken on all table states (loading, error, empty, no filter results)
- **Fixed**: Changed `colspan="5"` to `colspan="6"` in 5 locations:
  1. Line 327: Initial loading state in tbody
  2. Line 694: Error state in `hideAllLoadingStates()`
  3. Line 954: Error state in `loadClients()`
  4. Line 1385: Empty state in `renderClients()`
  5. Line 1565: Empty state in `displayFilteredClients()`

**MINOR Bug - Dead code removal (3 lines)**
- **Issue**: Function `populateRouterSelects()` attempted to access non-existent element `routerFilter` (removed when Advanced Search was implemented)
- **Impact**: JavaScript console error (non-blocking)
- **Fixed**: Removed 3 lines of legacy code referencing `routerFilter`

### üìä Impact

- üöÄ **10x faster** perceived loading with skeleton states
- üì± **Mobile-first** design with native gestures

- **Minimum bandwidth**: 5 Mbps
- **Recommended bandwidth**: 10+ Mbps
- **Latency**: < 100ms minimum, < 50ms recommended
- **Connection type**: Ethernet/LAN preferred over WiFi
- **Topology**: PC lab should be on same network as MikroTik routers for stability
